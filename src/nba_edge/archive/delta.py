"""Delta-encoded market boards: periodic full checkpoints plus field-level deltas between them.

Why this exists. A full board snapshot is ~276 KB compressed (2,818 markets, off-season), and at the
capture cadence that projects to ~4.9 GB/season -- a floor, against GitHub's ~1 GB guidance. But
between two boards four minutes apart only 9 of 2,818 markets moved (0.32%). Almost the entire cost
is rewriting prices that did not change.

Design rules, each of which is a requirement rather than a preference:

* **Existing full snapshots are checkpoints, unchanged.** Deltas are a NEW ledger kind. Nothing
  already on the archive is rewritten, re-encoded or deleted, and a reader that knows only about
  full snapshots keeps working exactly as before. That is also why reconstruction resolves its base
  from the ordinary ``kalshi/markets`` kind: every board ever captured is already a valid base.
* **Reconstruction is deterministic and fail-closed.** A board is checkpoint + an unbroken,
  hash-chained, contiguously numbered run of deltas. Any gap, reordering, conflicting duplicate or
  content mismatch raises; it never returns a half-applied board, because a silently-wrong
  historical price is worse than no price.
* **Historical truth, not current truth.** Reconstruction at ``t`` reads only artifacts observed at
  or before ``t``. Nothing later can influence the answer, so settlement, evaluation and research
  keep seeing the board as it was.
* **Provenance survives compression.** The exact capture instant and run id of every tick live in
  the delta header and are restamped onto reconstructed rows, so a reconstructed snapshot is equal
  to the real one *field for field*, including the ledger's own stamps -- not merely equivalent.

The ledger stamps ``_observed_at_utc`` and ``_run_id`` onto every row, and they change every tick.
Diffing them would mark all 2,818 markets as changed and defeat the whole exercise. They are
snapshot-level facts rather than per-market data, so they are excluded from the diff and the board
hash, carried once in the delta header, and restamped on the way out. That is the one subtlety in
this module and the reason ``canonical_board`` exists.
